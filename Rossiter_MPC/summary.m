FILES IN SUPPORT OF: Model-based predictive control: a practical approach,  
by J.A. Rossiter


These files are intended as a support to this book to enable
students to investigate predictive control algorithms from the formulation of the 
prediction equations right through to the closed-loop simulation. 
The code is mostly elementary MATLAB and is also transparent in structure.
Hence the files form useful templates for algorithm modifications or to 
formulate the precise scenario or plots desired. Example files are provided
to facilitate this. Some files allow for transfer 
function models and some for state space models and they cater for both SISO and MIMO
processes and include systematic constraint handling.
Most files do not use any MATLAB toolboxes but the few exceptions can easily be 
editted out with a small loss in functionality.

The files are provided free of charge and as such no guarantee is given as
to their behaviour nor are they intended to be comprehensive. However, USERS are 
invited to contact the author if they discover either bugs or wish to suggest 
useful improvements.
